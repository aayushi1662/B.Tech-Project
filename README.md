# B.Tech-Project
<ul>
  <li>The program reads and extracts data from a 3D design saved in an STL format file</li>
  <li>Developed and efficient algorithm to slice and generate tool path from a given STL file in linear time</li>
  <li>This tool path trajectory gives desired final product from the given raw material. Code is developed using MATLAB.</li>
  <li>This algorithm eliminates the need for contour evaluation by exploiting simple concept of topology.</li>
</ul>
